## FAQ

**Q: What makes HuePress coloring pages "therapy-grade"?**  
A: Our pages feature bold, thick lines (3-5mm stroke width) specifically designed for children with fine motor challenges, autism spectrum disorder, or ADHD. Each page is reviewed by licensed occupational therapists to ensure it supports developmental goals like hand-eye coordination, focus, and sensory regulation. Traditional coloring books use thin lines (1-2mm) that can frustrate children with motor delays.

**Q: Are HuePress pages suitable for children with autism?**  
A: Yes. Our "Bold" and "Easy" skill levels are specifically designed for children with autism, featuring:
- High-contrast, low-clutter designs to reduce sensory overwhelm
- Predictable, symmetrical patterns that support visual processing
- Large sections that are easier to color within
- Themes chosen for common special interests (animals, vehicles, nature)

**Q: How do I print HuePress coloring pages?**  
A: All pages are available as vector PDFs optimized for printing. Print on standard US Letter (8.5" x 11") or A4 paper using any home or office printer. HuePress Club members ($5/month) get unlimited downloads with no watermarks. Individual pages can be purchased for $1 each.

**Q: What age range are HuePress pages designed for?**  
A: Our pages are designed for ages 3-12, but we differentiate by developmental readiness, not chronological age:
- **Bold**: Ages 3-5 or children with significant motor delays (largest sections, thickest lines)
- **Easy**: Ages 4-7 or early elementary with typical development
- **Medium**: Ages 6-10 or children ready for moderate detail
- **Detailed**: Ages 8-12 or children who enjoy complexity

**Q: Can occupational therapists use HuePress pages in clinical settings?**  
A: Absolutely. Many pediatric OTs use HuePress pages in therapy sessions. HuePress Club membership includes a "Therapist License" allowing use with clients. We also offer bulk licensing for clinics and schools. Contact support@huepress.co for institutional pricing.

**Q: Do HuePress pages help with fine motor skills?**  
A: Yes. Coloring within lines requires:
- **Grip strength**: Holding crayons/markers develops hand muscles
- **Hand-eye coordination**: Matching hand movement to visual boundaries
- **Bilateral coordination**: Stabilizing paper with one hand while coloring with the other
- **Focus and attention**: Completing a page builds sustained attention skills

Our progression from Bold → Easy → Medium → Detailed allows gradual skill building.

**Q: How is HuePress different from free coloring sites?**  
A: HuePress pages are:
1. **OT-designed**: Not AI-generated or hastily traced clipart
2. **Ad-free**: No distractions or privacy concerns
3. **Print-optimized**: Vector PDFs that look crisp at any size
4. **Curated**: Every page meets quality and therapeutic standards
5. **Organized by skill**: Easy to find developmentally-appropriate pages

**Q: Can I use HuePress pages for commercial purposes (e.g., selling colored-in prints)?**  
A: No. HuePress pages are licensed for personal, educational, or clinical use only. Commercial use (reselling, mass distribution, or using in paid workshops without permission) is prohibited. Contact us for commercial licensing inquiries.
