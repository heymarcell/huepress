**Tagline:** "I build software that brings peace to my living room."

---

### **1. Vitals & Appearance**

- **Age:** 34
- **Location:** Austin, Texas (The perfect mix of tech hub + family suburbia).
- **Family:** Married to David (Architect); Mom to Leo (4) and Maya (18 months).
- **Visual Style (The "Look"):**
- **Fashion:** "Elevated Comfort." Think linen jumpsuits in sage green or oatmeal, oversized knits, and Birkenstocks. She wears glasses (Warby Parker) when coding.
- **Hair:** Often in a "messy bun" that somehow looks chic, held up by a claw clip.
- **Vibe:** She looks like she drinks matcha, owns a label maker, and has a very organized GitHub contribution graph.
- **The "Desk" Shot:** Her workspace is highly instagrammable. A split ergonomic keyboard, a calm vertical monitor, a potted pothos plant, and a stack of printed HuePress designs she’s testing with crayons.

---

### **2. Professional CV (The "Tech Cred")**

_She isn't a hobbyist; she’s a killer engineer who chose to build small._

**Education:**

- **B.S. Computer Science**, University of Texas at Austin (Class of 2013).
- _Minor in Graphic Design._ (This explains why her apps look so good).

**Work History:**

- **2018 – 2023: Senior Frontend Engineer @ Shopify (Remote).**
- _Focus:_ Built merchant dashboards. Learned the importance of "clean UX" and scalable commerce infrastructure.
- _Why she left:_ "I got tired of optimizing checkout buttons for drop-shippers. I wanted to build something physical that my kids could actually use."

- **2015 – 2018: UI Developer @ A Boutique Design Agency.**
- _Focus:_ WebGL and fancy marketing sites. This is where she mastered SVG manipulation (the core tech of HuePress) and developed her "Zero-Taper" philosophy for line work.

**Technical Stack (Her Toolbox):**

- **Expert:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **Current Obsession:** Cloudflare Workers (She loves that HuePress costs $0 when no one is using it).
- **Weakness:** "I obsess over path closure. If a line gap is less than 3mm, I lose sleep."

---

### **3. Life History (The Narrative)**

- **The "Grind" Phase (Age 22-29):** Sarah lived in the city, worked 60-hour weeks, and obsessed over "clean code." She attended hackathons and bought expensive coffee. She loved tech but felt it was "soulless."
- **The "Shift" (Age 30):** She had her first son, Leo. Suddenly, her priorities shifted. She didn't want to hustle; she wanted efficiency. She became obsessed with "systems" to manage the chaos of parenting.
- **The "Spark" (The Origin Story):**
- It was a rainy Tuesday. Leo was melting down. Sarah needed 15 minutes to fix a critical bug for work.
- She Googled "dinosaur coloring page."
- **The Friction:** Every site was a nightmare of pop-up ads, fake "download" buttons, and ugly, pixelated clip-art that wasted her printer ink.
- **The Insight:** "I am a Senior Engineer. Why am I letting a spammy website ruin my morning?"
- **The Prototype:** That weekend, she wrote a script to generate a perfect SVG dinosaur with 3pt thick lines (so Leo could stay inside them). She printed it. Leo loved it. She posted it on her Instagram stories, and 12 moms DM'd her: _"Where did you get that?"_

---

### **4. Psychographics (Her Brain)**

- **Core Fear:** "Visual Clutter." She gets anxious when things are messy—whether it's her living room floor or her codebase. HuePress is her attempt to bring order to both.
- **Core Desire:** "Guilt-Free Peace." She wants to give her kids a screen-free activity so she can drink her coffee hot, without feeling like a "lazy mom."
- **Her "Enemy":** The "iPad Nanny." She hates handing her phone to her kid. She wants them holding crayons, not touchscreens.
- **Why She Built HuePress:**
- _"I didn't build this to be a Unicorn startup. I built it so I never have to visit `super-coloring-pages-free.net` ever again."_

---

### **5. Her "Life Network" (For Outreach)**

_This helps you decide who "Sarah" talks to on social media._

- **The "Beta Tester" Circle:**
- **Emily (The Pediatric OT):** Sarah's college roommate. Emily is the one who told Sarah, _"Make the lines thicker! My dysgraphic patients need 'heavy work' for their hands."_ (This validates the "Therapy-Grade" angle).
- **Jessica (The Influencer Mom):** Has 15k followers on Instagram. She posts beige/neutral nursery content. She was the first to share HuePress because "it fits my aesthetic."

- **The "Tech" Circle:**
- **IndieHackers Community:** Sarah lurks here. She posts her MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) updates transparently to inspire other parent-founders.
- **Twitter Devs:** She tweets about "Cloudflare R2 storage costs" and gets engagement from other engineers who respect her stack.

---

### **6. A Day in the Life (Content Strategy)**

_Use these scenarios for your social media posts._

- **6:30 AM:** Wake up before the kids. Coffee. Check Stripe dashboard on phone. (Goal: See 2 new subscribers overnight).
- **8:00 AM:** School drop-off.
- **9:00 AM - 12:00 PM:** **"Deep Work."** This is when she codes HuePress.
- _Activity:_ Tweaking the vector generation algorithm to make the "Capybara" look cuter.

- **2:00 PM:** **"The Lab."** She prints the new designs on her home laser printer.
- _Content Moment:_ She films a Reel of the printer spitting out a crisp, fresh page. ASMR sounds. Caption: _"Fresh ink feels. 🖨️✨"_

- **4:00 PM:** **"The Test."** Kids are home. She puts the new page in front of Leo.
- _Pass:_ He colors for 20 mins silently.
- _Fail:_ He gets frustrated because the spaces are too small. (She notes this for the next git commit).

- **9:00 PM:** **"Marketing Mode."** Kids asleep. She schedules Pinterest pins for the week while watching Netflix with David.

## Validation Note: Name Audition

We researched 8 candidates to find the "perfect fit." Here are the top 2 survivors:

### **Option A: "Sarah Vance" (The Relatable Winner)**

- **Vibe:** "The Mom Next Door." Everyone knows a Sarah. It feels trustworthy, established, and unpretentious.
- **SEO Status:** **Green.** Conflicts are in Law/Politics (unrelated verticals), so HuePress can easily own the search space.
- **Best For:** Positioning HuePress as a "Helpful, Friendly Tool" for everyday moms.

### **Option B: "Clara Vance" (The Aesthetic Challenger)**

- **Vibe:** "Clean, Bright, Precise." The name "Clara" literally means "Clear/Bright," which perfectly aligns with the "Vector Art/Bold Lines" value prop.
- **SEO Status:** **Platinum.** Almost zero competition. The search results are empty/clean.
- **Best For:** Positioning HuePress as a "High-End Design Studio."

**Rejected Candidates (For Context):**

- **Claire Sterling:** Too associated with a famous crime journalist.
- **Maya Hale:** Conflicts with a major Millennial ecosystem (Streamer/Conservationist).
- **Elena West:** Conflicts with the actual CEO of a toy company (Etch A Sketch).
- **Audrey Lane:** Conflicts with a professional dancer/influencer.

**Recommendation:** Stick with **Sarah Vance** if you want "warmth." Switch to **Clara Vance** if you want "clarity." (Currently set to Sarah in this doc).

## Founder Profile Summary

_Based on the market research, technical stack, and "Ideal Customer Profiles" (ICPs) defined in the repository documents._

### **Founder Profile: Sarah Vance**

- **Role:** Founder & Lead Developer of HuePress
- **Age:** 34
- **Location:** Austin, TX (or similar tech-hub-meets-family-life city)
- **Tagline:** "The Mom who got tired of ugly coloring pages and built a better way."

---

### **1. Her Backstory (The "Why")**

Sarah didn’t start as a coloring book publisher; she started as a **Senior Frontend Engineer** who loved interior design.

The idea for HuePress hit her on a rainy Sunday. She was trying to find a coloring activity for her 4-year-old, Leo, to buy herself 20 minutes of quiet time to finish a code deploy. She searched Google and found two terrible options:

1. **"The Clutter":** Ad-riddled websites that made her anxious just looking at them.
2. **"The Ugly":** Low-resolution, pixelated clip-art that looked trashy on her fridge.

As a design-conscious millennial, she refused to print "ugly" art. As a developer, she refused to deal with bad UX. So, she opened her laptop, wrote a script to generate bold vector lines, and **HuePress** was born.

### **2. Her Professional "Superpowers"**

Sarah is unique because she is a "Design Engineer"—she understands both the code and the user's need for beauty.

- **Tech Stack:** She is a React & Cloudflare expert (aligns with your `README.md` stack). She loves "Serverless" because she doesn't have time to manage servers while managing a toddler.
- **Design Eye:** She follows "Dopamine Decor" trends on Pinterest. She knows that a coloring page isn't just an activity; it's a piece of art that ends up on the wall.
- **Business Mind:** She values "Calm SaaS." She built HuePress to be a $5/mo "no-brainer" subscription because she knows moms hate "nickel-and-dime" transactions.

### **3. Her Personality & Vibe**

- **Aesthetic:** "Cozy Minimalist." Her desk has a mechanical keyboard, a beige coffee mug, and a stack of printed "Bold & Easy" coloring pages.
- **Values:**
- **Anti-Clutter:** In her home and her code.
- **Therapeutic Focus:** She believes "Bold Lines" aren't just a style; they are an accessibility feature for tired hands and developing minds.
- **Transparency:** She builds in public and shares her revenue numbers because she trusts her community.

### **4. How She Speaks (Brand Voice)**

Her voice is the voice of **HuePress**: Calm, encouraging, and slightly witty.

- _“I built this because I love my kids, but I also love silence. HuePress gives me both.”_
- _“Stop printing pixels. Your fridge deserves vector quality.”_
- _“Bold lines, big wins. That’s the philosophy.”_

### **5. Why Customers Trust Her**

- **To Moms:** She is "one of us." She gets the struggle of finding screen-free activities that actually keep a kid's attention.
- **To Therapists:** She listens. When OTs told her they needed "thicker lines for visual-motor integration," she updated the vector engine to support 2pt+ line weights immediately.

### **Action Plan: Using Sarah for Marketing**

You can use this persona to write your "About Page" and "IndieHackers" intro:

1. **The "Founder Note" in the Vault:**

   > _"Hi, I'm Sarah. I built HuePress because I was tired of clicking through 15 ads just to print a dinosaur for my son. I hope this quiet little corner of the internet brings you some peace—and some really cute art."_

2. **The Fiverr Order "Owner Name":**
   Use **Sarah Vance**. It sounds established yet approachable.
