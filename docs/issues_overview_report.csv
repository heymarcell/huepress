"Meta Description: Duplicate","Opportunity","Low","116","100.000","Pages which have duplicate meta descriptions. It's really important to have distinct and unique meta descriptions that communicate the benefits and purpose of each page. If they are duplicate or irrelevant, then they will be ignored by search engines in their snippets.","Update duplicate meta descriptions as necessary, so important pages contain a unique and descriptive title for users and search engines. If these are duplicate pages, then fix the duplicated pages by linking to a single version, and redirect or use canonicals where appropriate.",""
"H1: Duplicate","Opportunity","Low","7","6.030","Pages which have duplicate <h1>s. It's important to have distinct, unique and useful main headings. If every page has the same <h1>, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate <h1>s as necessary, so important pages contain a unique and descriptive <h1> for users and search engines.  If these are duplicate pages, then fix the duplicated pages by linking to a single version, and redirect or use canonicals where appropriate.",""
"Meta Description: Over 985 Pixels","Opportunity","Low","2","1.720","Pages which have meta descriptions over Google's estimated pixel length limit for snippets. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise meta descriptions to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, and not visible to users.",""
"Page Titles: Over 60 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","15","12.930","Pages which have page titles that exceed the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results and carry less weight in scoring.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"Page Titles: Over 561 Pixels","Opportunity","Medium","15","12.930","Pages which have page titles over Google's estimated pixel length limit for titles in search results. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"URL: Parameters","Warning","Low","4","3.390","URLs that include parameters such as '?' or '&'. This isn't an issue for Google or other search engines to crawl unless at significant scale, but it's recommended to limit the number of parameters in a URL which can be complicated for users, and can be a sign of low value-add URLs.","Where possible use a static URL structure without parameters for key indexable URLs. However, changing URLs is a big decision, and often it's not worth changing them for SEO purposes alone. If URLs are changed, then appropriate 301 redirects must be implemented.",""
"Meta Description: Over 155 Characters","Opportunity","Low","2","1.720","Pages which have meta descriptions over the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results.","Write concise meta descriptions to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, and not visible to users.",""
"Security: Missing Content-Security-Policy Header","Warning","Low","118","100.000","URLs that are missing the Content-Security-Policy response header. This header allows a website to control which resources are loaded for a page. This policy can help guard against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that exploit the browser's trust of the content received from the server. The SEO Spider only checks for existence of the header, and does not interrogate the policies found within the header to determine whether they are well set-up for the website. This should be performed manually.","Set a strict Content-Security-Policy response header across all page to help mitigate cross site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.",""
"Images: Missing Size Attributes","Opportunity","Low","100","100.000","Image elements without dimensions (width and height size attributes) specified in the HTML. This can cause large layout shifts as the page loads and be frustrating experience for users. It is one of the major reasons that contributes to a high Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).","Define all image sizes as their native size using width and height attributes in the HTML. This allows the browser to calculate enough space for each image before it loads, avoiding large layout shifts.",""
"Page Titles: Below 30 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","3","2.590","Pages which have page titles under the configured limit. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it does indicate there might be room to target additional keywords or communicate your USPs.","Consider updating the page title to take advantage of the space left to include additional target keywords or USPs.",""
"Content: Low Content Pages","Opportunity","Medium","107","92.240","Pages with a word count that is below the default 200 words. The word count is based upon the content area settings used in the analysis which can be configured via 'Config > Content > Area'. There isn't a minimum word count for pages in reality, but the search engines do require descriptive text to understand the purpose of a page. This filter should only be used as a rough guide to help identify pages that might be improved by adding more descriptive content in the context of the website and page's purpose. Some websites, such as ecommerce, will naturally have lower word counts, which can be acceptable if a products details can be communicated efficiently.","Consider including additional descriptive content to help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
"Page Titles: Below 200 Pixels","Opportunity","Medium","1","0.860","Pages which have page titles much shorter than Google's estimated pixel length limit.

"Meta Description: Below 400 Pixels","Opportunity","Low","4","3.450","Pages which have meta descriptions much shorter than Google's estimated pixel length limit.

"Meta Description: Below 70 Characters","Opportunity","Low","4","3.450","Pages which have meta descriptions below the configured limit. This isn't strictly an issue, but an opportunity. There is additional room to communicate benefits, USPs or call to actions.","Consider updating the meta description to take advantage of the space left to include additional benefits, USPs or call to actions to improve click through rates (CTR).",""
"Meta Description: Multiple","Issue","Medium","116","100.000","Pages which have multiple meta descriptions. There should only be a single meta description for each page. Multiple meta descriptions are often caused by multiple conflicting plugins or modules in CMS.","Remove the additional meta description tags from the pages HTML, ensuring the website has a single, concise and descriptive meta description for important pages.",""
"H2: Multiple","Warning","Low","8","6.900","Pages which have multiple <h2>s. This is not an issue as HTML standards allow multiple <h2>'s when used in a logical hierarchical heading structure. However, this filter can help you quickly scan to review if they are used appropriately.","Ensure <h2>s are used in a logical hierarchical heading structure, and update where appropriate utilising the full heading rank between (h3 - h6) for additional headings.",""
"Page Titles: Duplicate","Opportunity","Medium","5","4.310","Pages which have duplicate page titles. It's really important to have distinct and unique page titles for every page.
