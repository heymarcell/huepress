# Marketing Plan for HuePress

## 1) Executive Summary

-   **Offer:** HuePress is a "curated studio" for bold, therapeutic-grade coloring pages, offered as a $5/mo digital subscription to design-conscious Millennial moms and pediatric therapists.
    
-   **ICP:** "The Aesthetic Mom" (30-45, values decor, hates clutter) and "The Pediatric Therapist" (needs functional, clear line art).
    
-   **Primary Goal (90 Days):** Acquire the first **100 paid subscribers** (Approx. $500 MRR) to validate product-market fit and willingness to pay.
    
-   **Chosen Channels:**
    
    -   **Pinterest:** The primary search engine for this demographic (high intent, visual).
        
    -   **Instagram (Reels):** For brand building ("dopamine decor" vibes) and trend-jacking.
        
    -   **SEO (Content):** Long-term asset building ("Bold and Easy" keyword dominance).
        
-   **Budget Scenario:** Lean ($100 - $300 total). Bootstrapped launch relying on organic reach + time equity.
    
-   **Top 5 Actions for Week 1:**
    
    1.  Finalize "The Vault" with 50 initial high-quality assets.
        
    2.  Set up Pinterest Business account and claim domain.
        
    3.  Create 15 "Pin templates" (Static & Video).
        
    4.  Configure Google Analytics 4 (GA4) + Pinterest Tag.
        
    5.  Soft launch to "Friends & Family" for UX testing.
        
-   **Key Risk:** **Churn.** Users downloading 50 files and cancelling immediately. Mitigation: Weekly "New Drops" to incentivize retention.
    

## 2) Brand & Offer Snapshot

-   **Elevator Pitch:** HuePress is the anti-clip-art studio for modern parents and therapists, delivering bold, frustration-free coloring pages that boost focus without the visual clutter.
    
-   **Audience:** Millennial Moms (Primary), Pediatric OTs/SLPs (Secondary).
    
-   **Problem:** Existing free sites are ad-riddled, "ugly," and frustratingly complex for young kids or motor-delayed patients.
    
-   **Promise:** "Therapy-grade" bold lines, 100% ad-free, aesthetic quality worthy of the fridge.
    
-   **Proof:** "Bold & Easy" guarantee (thick lines), curated by a "Trusted Publisher" persona.
    
-   **Pricing/Packaging:**
    
    -   **Freemium:** Watermarked low-res preview (Lead gen).
        
    -   **Club:** $5/mo or $45/yr (Unlimited, high-res, unwatermarked).
        
-   **Sales Motion:** Self-serve web checkout (Stripe/Clerk).
    
-   **Assumptions:**
    
    -   Users will pay for _convenience_ (no ads) and _curation_ despite free alternatives.
        
    -   Pinterest traffic will convert at ~1-2% on a $5 offer.
        
    -   Content production (AI + Vectorizing) takes <10 mins per asset.
